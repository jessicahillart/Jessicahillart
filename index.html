<p><a href="https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/">Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</a></p>

<p>Dieter Ramsâ€™ famous principles can be applied to all disciplines of design and this site presents them in an almost print-like layout with a reduced color scheme and grid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themessageismediumrare.com/">The Message is Medium Rare</a></p>

<p>A blog of sorts about two designers eating a hamburger every week and trying to extract a design metaphor from them. It is easy to read with a simple, intentional layout to present the lesson.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-makes-them-similar-and-different" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-them-similar-and-different"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<p><strong>Similar</strong></p>

<p>The size, spacing, and bold typography create an extremely clear visual hierarchy. They are both examples of clean design where simplicity can speak volumes.</p><strong>Different</strong>

<p><a href="https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/">Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</a> doesn't have a traditional navigation bar at the top, but rather a navigation button on the upper right side. This presents the website more like a magazine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themessageismediumrare.com/">The Message is Medium Rare</a> is a more traditional site, although the navigation bar is beneath the text header, which does break from conventional norms. However, it does have a lot of information below the fold, which can be difficult to read.</p>

<li><strong>Thumbnail Sketch 1</strong></li>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/127346738@N08/15455298641" title="Layout-One by Jess Hill, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3928/15455298641_0c692dd24f_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Layout-One"></a><p>Image 1 demonstrates a minimalist, simple grid layout, which aims to provide the user with the bare-minimum needed for creating a responsive CSS grid layout. Focal point and hierarchy are shown by using the large image square at the top, and smaller squares that follow beneath. </p>
<li><strong>Thumbnail Sketch 2</strong></li>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/127346738@N08/15271877127" title="Layout-Two by Jess Hill, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3935/15271877127_1b7f4ebae9_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Layout-Two"></a><p>Image 2 still keeps the grid layout,but Focal point and hierarchy are shown by moving your eye from left to right. It has less of a main focal point, but still has a clear hierarchy.</p>
