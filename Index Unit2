<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p><a href="https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/">Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.themessageismediumrare.com/">The Message is Medium Rare</a></p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p><a href="https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/">Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</a></p>
<p>Dieter Rams’ famous principles can be applied to all disciplines of design and this site presents them in an almost print-like layout with a reduced color scheme and grid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themessageismediumrare.com/">The Message is Medium Rare</a></p>
<p>A blog of sorts about two designers eating a hamburger every week and trying to extract a design metaphor from them. It’s easy to read with a simple, intentional layout to present the lesson.</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p><b>Similar</b></p>
<p>The size, spacing, and bold typography create an etremely clear visual hierachy. They are both examples of clean design where simplicity can speak volumes.</P
<p><b>Different</b></p>
<p><a href="https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/">Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</a> doesn't have a traditional navigation bar at the top, but rather a navigation button on the upper right side. This presents the website more like a magazine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.themessageismediumrare.com/">The Message is Medium Rare</a> is a more traditional site, although the navigation bar is beneath the text header, which does break from conventional norms. However, it does have a lot of information below the fold, which can be difficult to read.</p>
