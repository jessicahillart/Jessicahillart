It is easy to read with a simple, intentional layout to present the lesson.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Similar</strong></p>\r\n<p>The size, spacing, and bold typography create an extremely clear visual hierarchy. They are both examples of clean design where simplicity can speak volumes.</P\r\n<p><strong>Different</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/\">Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</a> doesn't have a traditional navigation bar at the top, but rather a navigation button on the upper right side. This presents the website more like a magazine.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.themessageismediumrare.com/\">The Message is Medium Rare</a> is a more traditional site, although the navigation bar is beneath the text header, which does break from conventional norms. However, it does have a lot of information below the fold, which can be difficult to read.</p>\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n <li><strong>Thumbnail Sketch 1</strong></li>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/127346738@N08/15455298641\" title=\"Layout-One by Jess Hill, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3928/15455298641_0c692dd24f_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Layout-One\"></a><p>Image 1 demonstrates a minimalist, simple grid layout, which aims to provide the user with the bare-minimum needed for creating a responsive CSS grid layout. Focal point and hierarchy are shown by using the large image square at the top, and smaller squares that follow beneath. </p>\r\n<li><strong>Thumbnail Sketch 2</strong></li>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/127346738@N08/15271877127\" title=\"Layout-Two by Jess Hill, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3935/15271877127_1b7f4ebae9_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Layout-Two\"></a><p>Image 2 still keeps the grid layout,but Focal point and hierarchy are shown by moving your eye from left to right. It has less of a main focal point, but still has a clear hierarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n</ul>  \r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
